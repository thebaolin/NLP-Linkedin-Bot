### UHired:
A linkedin-url based optimization bot, built to combat the possible bias that comes from an ATS Scan during the job application process, through the usage of NLP. 
###
#### What is an ATS?
ATS stands for Applicant Tracking System, and is used by mainly software recruiters and employers to track candidates through the recruiting and hiring process. Because an ATS is used to further simplify and speed up the hiring process, candidates who don't pass the filter will automatically be rejected. 

With UHired, you can receive valuable feedback/data to help you pass those filters and secure your dream job. 
####
##### How It Works:
1) User pastes linkedin-url for the job they are applying for in UHired's search bar.
2) Outputs meaningful and coherent sentences, generated specifically by webscraping the key elements the ATS software looks for, using Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
3) Now, users can properly gauge what recruiters and hiring managers are looking for in their resumes and Linkedin profiles. What the users decide to do with the data is completely up to them.
#####
###### Next Steps:
- Not limiting the user input to just Linkedin URLs (ex: the user might be able to input a role at a specific company)
